Smugley with his tiny legs didn't get to far. He tried and tried to keep moving on
but so exhausted from all the walking he instead built a car. The car had no wheels but fortunally Lok found some and hastily put them on.
Before they can start the car Grumly and Squaky appears. They have seen the construction and would want the car for themselves. But they are too late, even with his long legs Grumly can not run as fast as a car and Smugley and Lok gets away.
